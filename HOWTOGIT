After you change some files,
do a git status- things in red will not be commited.
git add "filename" all the things that you want to commit (files you changed or added)
git remove if you want to get rid of a file
git status again to make sure all the changes you want to make are green
then git commit -m "your message here"
and finally, git push
before you start coding, git pull to update your local files to the latest ones from the git repo
